# Pokemon TCG Pocket Card database

An Open source database of cards for the pokemon trading card game pocket mobile game.

The goal of this repository is to create a standard, scalable and up-to-date collection of the cards as the game evolves so they can be used by the community to create apps for the game.

## How to use

All cards can be found within the cards directory. Within the cards directory, you will find subdirectories for each supported locale. Finally, within those folders you'll find a JSON file for each set.

## Contribution

If there are any issues, feel free to raise them. PRs are also welcome if you would like to improve on the data set.
